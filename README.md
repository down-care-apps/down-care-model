# Down Syndrome Detection Using Facial Analysis

## 🧬 Project Overview

This computer vision project aims to detect potential Down syndrome markers in children between 0-6 years old through sophisticated facial feature analysis. By combining cutting-edge machine learning techniques with facial landmark detection, the system provides an innovative approach to screening. The developed model is then used in the DownCare app to assist in early detection and support.
